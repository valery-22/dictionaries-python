Python dictionary is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries provide efficient lookup of values based on their corresponding keys, making them ideal for representing data as mappings or associative arrays.
